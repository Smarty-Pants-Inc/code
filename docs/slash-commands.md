# Slash Commands

Codex CLI supports a set of slash commands you can type at the start of the
composer input. These commands provide quick actions, toggles, or expand into
full prompts. This document lists all built‑in commands and what they do.

Notes

- Commands are shown in the TUI’s slash popup; the order below matches the UI.
- Commands marked “prompt‑expanding” transform your input into a full prompt and
  typically kick off multi‑agent flows.
- Some commands accept arguments; if required, usage is shown in parentheses.

## Navigation & Session

- `/browser`: open internal browser.
- `/chrome`: connect to Chrome.
- `/new`: start a new chat during a conversation.
- `/resume`: resume a past session for this folder.
- `/quit`: exit Codex.
- `/logout`: log out of Codex.

## Workspace & Git

- `/init`: create an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for Codex.
- `/diff`: show `git diff` (including untracked files).
- `/branch` branch management:
  - `/branch [task]`: create a worktree branch and switch to it (back‑compat). If a task/description is provided, it is used when naming the branch.
  - `/branch create <slug> [--dir <path>]`: create the worktree in a specific base directory. `<path>` accepts absolute or repo‑relative paths. When omitted, the base directory is resolved by priority: `CODE_WORKTREES_DIR` → `SMARTY_JOBS__WORKTREES_DIR` → `.smarty/config.yaml: worktrees_dir` → default `.worktrees/`.
  - `/branch info [<slug>] [--dir <path>]`: show the resolved base directory, chosen branch name, base ref (HEAD), absolute path, and which source provided the directory.

## UX & Display

- `/theme`: switch between color themes.
- `/verbosity (high|medium|low)`: change text verbosity.
- `/reasoning (minimal|low|medium|high)`: change reasoning effort.
- `/prompts`: show example prompts.
- `/status`: show current session configuration and token usage.
- `/mcp`: manage MCP servers (status/on/off/add).

## Search & Mentions

- `/mention`: mention a file (opens the file search for quick insertion).

## Performance & Agents

- `/perf (on|off|show|reset)`: performance tracing controls.
- `/agents`: list agents (running and availability).

## Prompt‑Expanding (Multi‑Agent)

These commands expand into full prompts (generated by `codex-core`) and
typically start multiple agents. They require a task/problem description.

- `/plan <task>`: create a comprehensive plan (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/solve <problem>`: solve a challenging problem (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/code <task>`: perform a coding task (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.

## Development‑Only

- `/test-approval`: test approval request (available in debug builds only).

Implementation Notes

- The authoritative list of commands is defined in
  `codex-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs` (the `SlashCommand` enum). When adding a
  new command, please update this document to keep the UI and docs in sync.
- Prompt formatting for `/plan`, `/solve`, and `/code` lives in
  `codex-rs/core/src/slash_commands.rs`.
