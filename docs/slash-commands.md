# Slash Commands

Codex CLI supports a set of slash commands you can type at the start of the
composer input. These commands provide quick actions, toggles, or expand into
full prompts. This document lists all built‑in commands and what they do.

Notes

- Commands are shown in the TUI’s slash popup; the order below matches the UI.
- Commands marked “prompt‑expanding” transform your input into a full prompt and
  typically kick off multi‑agent flows.
- Some commands accept arguments; if required, usage is shown in parentheses.

## Navigation & Session

- `/browser`: open internal browser.
- `/chrome`: connect to Chrome.
- `/new`: start a new chat during a conversation.
- `/resume`: resume a past session for this folder.
- `/quit`: exit Codex.
- `/logout`: log out of Codex.
- `/login`: manage Code sign-ins (select, add, or disconnect accounts).

## Workspace & Git

- `/init`: create an `AGENTS.md` file with instructions for Codex.
- `/diff`: show `git diff` (including untracked files).
- `/undo`: open a snapshot picker so you can restore workspace files to a
  previous Code snapshot and optionally rewind the conversation to that point.
- `/branch [task]`: create a worktree branch and switch to it. If a
  task/description is provided, it is used when naming the branch. Must be run
  from the repository root (not inside another branch worktree). Set
  `CODE_BRANCH_COPY_CACHES=1` (legacy: `CODEX_BRANCH_COPY_CACHES=1`) to mirror
  `node_modules` and Rust build caches into the worktree; otherwise no cache
  directories are copied automatically.
- `/merge`: merge the current worktree branch back into the default branch and
  remove the worktree. Run this from inside the worktree created by `/branch`.
- `/review [focus]`: without arguments, opens a review picker so you can audit
  the workspace, a specific commit, compare against another branch, or enter
  custom instructions. With a focus argument, skips the picker and uses your
  text directly. Use the Review options dialog to toggle Auto Resolve if you
  want Codex to rerun fixes and review checks automatically.
- `/cloud`: browse Codex Cloud tasks, view details, apply patches, and create
  new tasks from the TUI.
- `/cmd <name>`: run a project command defined for the current workspace.

## UX & Display

- `/theme`: switch between color themes.
- `/verbosity (high|medium|low)`: change text verbosity.
- `/model`: choose what model and reasoning effort to use.
- `/reasoning (minimal|low|medium|high)`: change reasoning effort.
- `/prompts`: show example prompts.
- `/status`: show current session configuration and token usage.
- `/limits`: visualize current hourly and weekly rate-limit usage.
- `/update`: check the installed version, detect available upgrades, and open a
  guided upgrade terminal that runs the installer interactively when possible.
- `/notifications`: inspect and toggle TUI notifications.
- `/mcp`: manage MCP servers (status/on/off/add).
- `/validation [status|on|off|<tool> (on|off)]`: inspect or toggle validation
  harness settings.

## Search & Mentions

- `/mention`: mention a file (opens the file search for quick insertion).

## Performance & Agents

- `/perf (on|off|show|reset)`: performance tracing controls.
- `/agents`: list agents (running and availability).
  including autonomous follow-ups and observer status (available in dev,
  dev-fast, and pref builds).
- `/auto [goal]`: start the maintainer-style auto coordinator. If no goal is
  provided it defaults to "review the git log for recent changes and come up
  with sensible follow up work".

## Prompt‑Expanding (Multi‑Agent)

These commands expand into full prompts (generated by `codex-core`) and
typically start multiple agents. They require a task/problem description.

- `/plan <task>`: create a comprehensive plan (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/solve <problem>`: solve a challenging problem (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.
- `/code <task>`: perform a coding task (multiple agents). Prompt‑expanding.

## Development‑Only

- `/demo`: populate the chat history with assorted sample cells (available in
  dev and perf builds for UI testing).
- `/test-approval`: test approval request (available in debug builds only).

Implementation Notes

- The authoritative list of commands is defined in
  `code-rs/tui/src/slash_command.rs` (the `SlashCommand` enum). When adding a
  new command, please update this document to keep the UI and docs in sync.
- Prompt formatting for `/plan`, `/solve`, and `/code` lives in
  `code-rs/core/src/slash_commands.rs`.
  When no `[[agents]]` are configured, the orchestrator advertises the
  following agent names to the LLM for multi‑agent runs: `claude`, `gemini`,
  `qwen`, `code`, and `cloud`. You can replace or pin this set via `[[agents]]`
  or per‑command `[[subagents.commands]].agents`.
